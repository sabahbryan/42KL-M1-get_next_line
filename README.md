# 42KL-M1-get_next_line
This repository contains my work on 42KL's get_next_line. It's 1 of 3 projects for Milestone 1.

The main objective is to create a function that return lines from the file descriptor. It must also make use of static variables to assist in "counting".

For the bonus objectives, the functions must be able to handle multiple file descriptors at once and the get_next_line function must only contain a single variable.
